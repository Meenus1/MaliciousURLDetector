# Malicious URL Detector – Mobile Application (Machine Learning + Firebase)

This project is a mobile application that detects malicious URLs using a **trained Machine Learning model** and **Google Safe Browsing API**.  
The app communicates with a Python backend via **Firebase Realtime Database** to provide real-time URL safety classification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Detects malicious URLs using a deep learning model (BiLSTM)
- Real-time URL classification using Firebase
- Secondary verification using Google Safe Browsing API
- Android mobile application (built using Kodular)

## 🛠 Installation & Usage

1️⃣ Clone the repository
  - git clone https://github.com/Meenus1/MaliciousURLDetector.git
  - cd MaliciousURLDetector

2️⃣ Install dependencies
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

3️⃣ Start the backend server (Google Colab recommended)
  - Open server_code.ipynb in Google Colab
  - Run all cells
  - Keep the notebook running while using the app

4️⃣ Use the mobile app
  - Install the APK on Android
  - Enter a URL → receive the safety result in real-time

## 🧠 Model Details
- MaliciousUrlDetector.h5	- Trained BiLSTM model to classify URLs
- tokenizer.pkl	- Converts input URLs into integer sequences for model input
- label_encoder.pkl	- Converts predicted class index → (safe / malicious) label

- Training dataset and .ipynb training notebooks are not included due to size and copyright limitations.

---

## 🔥 Firebase Configuration
The backend listens to the following Realtime Database values:

- Server/Busy	- Notifies server when a URL is submitted
- Server/Url	- Encoded URL sent by mobile app
- Server/Username	- Username who initiated the scan
- USERS/<username>/Result	- Scan result returned by the backend
